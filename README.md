Write the Tic-tac-toe game in R

Tic-tac-toe is a paper-and-pencil game for two players. X and O, who take turns marking the spaces in a 3Ã—3 grid. The player who first has three of their marks in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal row is the winner. Here, I write the game in R, and there are 2 modes, you can either play with another player, or you can play with the computer. 

You can copy the code in your Rstudio and try to play it, have fun!
