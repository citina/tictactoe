Write the Tic-tac-toe game in R

Tic-tac-toe, also known as noughts and crosses, is a paper-and-pencil game for two players. X and O, who take turns marking the spaces in a 3Ã—3 grid. The player who first has three of their marks in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal row is the winner. Here, I write the game in R, and there are two modes, you can either play against another player or play against the computer. 

R language is widely used as a tool for data mining and data analysis. Even it is not an optimal language for writing games, but it is a good and fun practice for getting more familiar with it.

You can download the file and play the game in Rstudio, have fun!
